# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control? 
Version control is a timestamped record of all past edits to code. 
Why is it useful?
This provides a working record of not only what happened but who did it. This is helpful for when searching for errors or comparing the efficacy of new and old changes. By having different versions the evolution of a code is also easily viewed and recalled if needed. 
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is a way of working off of the original code without editing the master code. Branches are esentially copies of the master that let mutiple people work in tandem. A branch and its changes will not be available to all of the other users though until it is merged back with the master branch. Branches are great ways of working on and organizing subsets of a project
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit is the action of actually saving staged changes back to the git. This saves the changes and also creates a time stamp as well as a record of who made the commit. A good commit message focuses on the speicifc changes that were made since the last commit and highlights the unique feature of that commit in a way that can easily be identified and reaccessed if needed.
* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflicts occur when changes are made to the same line of code that do not match or when someone is attempting to edit code and the code (or file) is deleted. Basically it is when the code becomes colfiting or unreconizable with the source and choices and changes have to be selected to make the versions compatable again.
