## Study plan

I plan on first watching videos to get a broad introduction to the topic. I saw that someone posted one in a slack channel so that seems like a good place to start. From there I probably find another video that goes a little more indepth. Based on how I feel after those first few videos I may either start to play with a file on my own or go into a few forums and look for some of the pieces I still feel that I am missing. Based on how that is going I will then start trouble shooting using resouces such as stack overflow until I am comfortable with what I am trying to accomplish.


$(document).ready(function(){
	
});

$('img').delay(500).fadeOut(500, function(){
	$(this).attr('src', 'img2.jpg').fadeIn(500);
});

I liked starting with videos. It gave me a good way to get oriented and see what was happening. I also liked that through those videos I was given personal tips and short hands. Now that I am oriented I feel that i can use the jquery docs and forums to find whatever skill I am trying to itgerate into a doument. I liked getting a general overview first with a person. That really matched my learning style.
