Linux gives the power to the user, and assumes that the user knows what they are doing. Other systems are notorious for controlling what the user can or cannot do, where linux does not. Linux wanted to give the user the opportunity to do whatever they wanted with their machine and a platform that allows them to freely do just that. They focused on "flexibility, simplicity and freedom."

## VPS

 A VPS is a completely virtual computer that is sectioned off part of a larger server, but runs as its own independent machine. Complete with its own operating system

 Some advantages are that they are lower in cost to operate because they are only part of one machine not their own one, and many servers can be run on one larger machine. Each vps is segregated and is isolated from everything else, and the are very secure.

 ##ROOT

 You want to leave root as the main administrator for the comuter that is used on an as needed basis. The root directory has all the permissions and you do not want to give access to those to others. Root is also used for recovery when other things crash, and if its root that crashes, you have nothing to use to recover. Also its just good practice to not do that.
