How to use an elevator:

-Approach the elevator and locate the sign indicating the location of the space you are trying to reach.
	*Note not only the floor number but suite number as well.

- Press either the up or down arrow dependent on where the office is relative to your location, if it is on a floor below you press the down arrow, if it is on a floor above you, press the up arrow. Once the button has been selected it will become illuminated.(
	*the button will remain illuminated until the elevator reaches your floor, and will also be accompanied by a dinging noise. 

- As the doors open, allow any people already in the elevator to exit first. Then enter the elevator and about-face.
 
- Next locate the keypad and select the button that corresponds with the floor number that you are trying to reach. 

-Once you, and everyone else, is in the elevator and your floor number has been selected, press the close door button ( if it hasn’t done so already automatically) which looks like two arrows pointing towards each other and says “close” or “close door”

-The elevator will then move to the next floor that someone has selected and open the doors (this may be your floor this may not depending on who else is on the elevator)

-Then, once the elevator indicates that it is on the floor you are seeking (and the number above the door matches the number you pressed) exit the elevator once the doors have opened completely. 

-Finally determine which direction you need to travel to reach your destination.

Brushing your teeth:

-Locate the bathroom, or where ever the toothbrushes are stored and their is a sink nearby.

-Find the toothbrushes and select yours

-Turn on the water to a warm temperature and rinse your brush throughly (about 20 seconds)

-Locate the toothpaste and remove the cap by twisting it counter-clockwise

-Squeeze a pea sized amount of toothpaste (squeezing from the bottom of the tube) onto the bristles of your toothbrush

-Recap the toothpaste and put it back where it was found

-Begin brushing your teeth by putting the bristles of your toothbrush in your mouth.

-Select a location within your mouth and brush all surfaces of that area first (i.e. top left, top right, top front or top back) by moving your brush back and forth quickly over those given teeth

- Repeat this process until all teeth and surfaces of the mouth have been cleaned.

- Next spit out any remaining toothpaste that is in your mouth into the sink (it is important not to swallow any)

-Then rinse your mouth with water from a cup to ensure that all toothpaste (and all other gook) is out of your mouth

-Finally rinse your toothbrush throughly and place it back in the cabinet or drawer in which it was found to be stored for later use.
